## About

This project uses [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com) to generate a REST API for a basic JSON DB.

For more information on all the things you can do with Feathers visit [docs.feathersjs.com](http://docs.feathersjs.com).

## Getting Started

Start the REST API, but without auto reload if files change.

    ```
    npm start
    ```

or use

    ```
    npm run nodemon
    ```

when developing

## Testing

Simply run `npm test` and all your tests in the `test/` directory will be run.

## Scaffolding

Feathers has a powerful command line interface. Here are a few things it can do:

```
$ npm install -g feathers-cli             # Install Feathers CLI

$ feathers generate service               # Generate a new Service
$ feathers generate hook                  # Generate a new Hook
$ feathers generate model                 # Generate a new Model
$ feathers help                           # Show all commands
```
